    ABSTRACT = {Gene expression in bacteria is a remarkably controlled and intricate process
impacted by many factors. One such factor is the genomic position of a gene
within a bacterial genome. Genes located near the origin of replication generally
have a higher expression level, increased dosage, and are often more conserved
than genes located farther from the origin of replication. The majority of the
studies involved with these findings have only noted this phenomenon in a single
gene or cluster of genes that was re-located to pre-determined positions within a
bacterial genome. In this work, we look at the overall expression levels from
eleven bacterial data sets from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis,
Streptomyces, and Sinorhizobium meliloti. We have confirmed that gene expression
tends to decrease when moving away from the origin of replication in majority of
the replicons analysed in this study. This study sheds light on the impact of
genomic location on molecular trends such as gene expression and highlights the
importance of accounting for spatial trends in bacterial molecular analysis.},
